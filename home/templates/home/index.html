<!-- This tells search engines to use this URL as the main page, and that it shouldn't index other pages -->
<!-- So if you have a site with multiple URLs, they're treated as seperate sites. This messes with the SEO, so putting this in
    with the correct link gives you better results, and more accuracy with data tracking -->

    Bing to judge your site based on that content -->
